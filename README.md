# Webapp Kmom10

This is the final project for the course [WebApp](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/webapp-v4).

The goal for this project was to create an app (client) that would fetch different kind of information regarding trains that had been delayed.

The framework used was [react-native](https://reactnative.dev) and developed using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client).
